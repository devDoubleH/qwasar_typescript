## count_letter

Write a function that takes a string and a character as parameters and returns the number of times the character appears in the string.

```js
const count_letter = (str: string);
```

## number_of_equivalent_domino_pairs

Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a==c and b==d), or (a==d and b==c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.

Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].

```js
const number_of_equivalent_domino_pairs = (dominoes: number[][]);
```

## print_duplicates

Write a function that takes a string as parameter and prints the duplicate characters in the string.

```js
const print_duplicates = (str: string);
```

## str_maxlenoc

Write a function that takes a string as parameter and returns the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
